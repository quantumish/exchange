# exchange
> a simple financial exchange simulation

`exchange` is a simple multiplayer demo of the basics behind exchanges: view the limit order book update in real time as you and some friends try to sell/buy the shares you need! 

Used as a demo in a 2023 Nueva Intersession class.

Written entirely in Rust! Backend is a websocket server written with `poem` and frontend is a hacky Rust WebAssembly stew.
